# Z-THEA

## Description:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and yarn
- You have an OpenAI API key

Note: | Make sure to keep your API keys secret and never share them with anyone.

## Setup and Configuration

1. Install the required dependencies: `yarn`
1. Create a `config.json` file in the project's src directory to store your API keys:

```
{
  "OPENAI_ORGANISATION": "<your-organisation-key-here>",
  "OPENAI_APIKEY": "<your-api-key-here>"
}
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
